# Consensus Network
<!--{# TODO: Are we learning about the Consensus Network or the Consensus Process? Both? Is one a child of the other -- or is the parent concept simply Consensus? Also, need to be careful to differentiate this content from the content we provide in Concepts > XRP Ledger Basics > Consensus. What should I expect to learn here - and how is it different from what I will learn there? #}-->
The primary role of consensus is for participants in the process to agree on which XRP Ledger transactions are to be processed as a group to resolve the double spend problem. This section covers concepts that help you learn the "what" and "why" behind fundamental aspects of consensus in the XRP Ledger.

* **[Consensus Principles and Rules](x)**

      Understand the principles and rules involved in reaching consensus in the XRP Ledger, including some background on the double-spend problem and details about how consensus works.
<!--{# TODO: this language needs to be refined based on what we're actually focusing on here. Are these the principles and rules of consensus, the network, or the process? https://developers.ripple.com/concept-reaching-consensus.html #}-->

* **[Validators and the Trust Topology](x)**
<!--{# TODO: need this intro text - what is this about? What page does it link to? New content? #}-->

* **[Amendments](x)**

      An amendment is a fully-functional feature or change, waiting to be enabled by the peer-to-peer network as a part of the consensus process. Understand the purpose of amendments and the amendment voting process.

* **[Fee Voting](x)**

      Fees include basic transaction costs as well as reserve requirements. Validators can vote for changes to fees. Understand the purpose and process of fee voting.

* **[Pseudo-Transactions](x)**

      Pseudo-transactions are never submitted by users, nor are they propagated through the network. Instead, a server may choose to inject them directly into a proposed ledger. If enough servers inject an equivalent pseudo-transaction for it to pass consensus, then it is included in the ledger. Understand the purpose and processing of pseudo-transactions.
