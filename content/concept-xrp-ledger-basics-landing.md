<!--{# TODO: I believe this is https://developers.ripple.com/concept-consensus.html -- but need to be careful to differentiate this content from the content we provide in Concepts > Consensus Network. What should I expect to learn here - and how is it different from what I will learn there? Refine this intro sentence based on what we decide. #}-->

* **[Fees](x)**

      Learn about the types of fees allowed by the XRP Ledger, including neutral fees (payable to no one) that protect the ledger against abuse, as well as fees that users can collect from each other.

<!--{# TODO: Note the XRP section below. It contains content from https://developers.ripple.com/concept-money.html -- not sure of where this article stops and the discussion of XRP itself should begin. #}-->

* **[Source and Destination Tags](x)**

* **[Software Ecosystem](x)**
<!--{# TODO: Not sure what this is about #}-->

* **[XRP](x)**
<!--{# TODO:  https://developers.ripple.com/concept-money.html#xrp -- but this is a subsection of Money in the XRP Ledger -- see above. Need to figure out where that article's discussion of XRP stops and where this one begins. Write the overview sentence once that is decided. #}-->

* **[FAQ](x)**
<!--{# TODO: I was thinking that we could host this article on the Dev Portal instead of on ripple.com as it is very technical and answers questions that our devs would have: https://ripple.com/technical-faq-xrp-ledger/ -- but we should coordinate with Marketing. It is currently accessed under the Support heading in the footer two links above access to the Dev Portal. #}-->
