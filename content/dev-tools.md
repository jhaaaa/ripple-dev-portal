# XRP Ledger Developer Tools
We provide a set of developer tools to help you test, explore, and validate XRP Ledger API requests and behavior.

## [XRP Ledger Lookup Tool](x)
Use this JSON-RPC-based debugging tool to print raw information about a XRP Ledger account, transaction, or ledger.

## [XRP Ledger Test Net](x)
Use the WebSocket and JSON-RPC Test Net endpoints to test software built on the XRP Ledger without using real funds. Generate Test Net credentials and funds for testing purposes. The ledger and balances are reset on a regular basis.

For information about how to connect your `rippled` test server to the Test Net, see [XXXXX](x).

## [rippled API WebSocket Tool](x)
Need to see the rippled API in action ASAP? Use this tool to send prepopulated sample requests and get responses. No setup required.
<!--{# which methods are surfaced here -- is this all of them? #}-->

## [Data API v2 Tool](x)
Need to see the Data API v2 in action ASAP? Use this tool to send prepopulated sample requests and get responses. No setup required.

## [rippled.txt Validator](x)
