# [XRP Ledger: A Decentralized Cryptographic Ledger](x)

The XRP Ledger is an open source, decentralized cryptographic ledger. It provides a distributed payment system enabling users to transfer value seamlessly around the world. XRP is the native digital asset of the XRP Ledger and is designed to bridge the many different currencies in use worldwide. 

While there are many contributors, Ripple stewards the development of the XRP Ledger and advances XRP as a key contribution to the Internet of Value: a world in which money moves the way information does today.

## [The Digital Asset for Payments](x)

XRP is a digital asset native to the XRP Ledger. Being an open source protocol, anyone with a cryptographic key and an internet connection can receive, hold, and send XRP to anyone else.

## [Censorship-Resistant Transaction Processing](x)

No single party decides which XRP transactions succeed or fail, and no one can "roll back" a transaction after it completes.


[![image caption](img/image.png)](img/image.png)

## [Fast, Efficient Consensus Algorithm](x)

The XRP Ledger's consensus algorithm settles transactions in 3 to 5 seconds, processing at a throughput of 1,500 transactions per second.

## [Finite XRP Supply](x)

When the XRP Ledger began, 100 billion XRP were created, and no more XRP will ever be created. (Each XRP is subdivisible down to 6 decimal places.)


[![image caption](img/image.png)](img/image.png)

## [Responsible Software Governance](x)

A team of full-time, world-class developers at Ripple maintain and continually improve the XRP Ledger's underlying software.


[![image caption](img/image.png)](img/image.png)

## [Secure, Adaptable Cryptography](x)

The XRP Ledger relies on industry standard digital signature systems like ECDSA (the same scheme used by Bitcoin) but also supports modern algorithms like Ed25519.

## [Modern Features for Smart Contracts](x)

Features like Escrow, Checks, and Payment Channels support cutting-edge financial applications including the Interledger Protocol.


[![image caption](img/image.png)](img/image.png)

## [On-Ledger Centralized Exchange](x)

The XRP Ledger has a fully-functional accounting system for tracking and trading obligations denominated in any way users want, and an exchange built into the protocol.

# Built on the XRP Ledger

Learn about just a few of the types of integrations developers have built on the XRP Ledger.

## Exchanges & Gateways

[![exchange icon](img/exchange.png)](img/exchange.png)

Integrate your Exchange or Gateway with the XRP Ledger to enable your users to buy and sell XRP and issued currencies.

[Use Case](x)

## Market Makers

[![market maker icon](img/market-maker.png)](img/market-maker.png)

Integrate with the XRP Ledger to place offers algorithmically or through your own trading interface, providing liquidity between different gateways and their users.

[Use Case](x)

## Wallets

[![wallet icon](img/wallet.png)](img/wallet.png)

Build a wallet app on the XRP Ledger to enable your users to send and trade XRP and other currencies issued by a gateway you trust.
