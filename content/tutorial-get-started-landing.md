# Get Started
Get up and running with some of the key tools you'll use to work with the XRP Ledger.

* **[Get Started with the `rippled` API](x)**

      Learn how to make your first requests to the `rippled` API using our WebSocket and JSON-RPC interfaces. We'll also show you how to make requests to the command line interface, which is not officially supported, but which can be useful for testing and development.

* **[Get Started with `ripple-lib` for JavaScript](x)**

      Learn how to make your first requests to `ripple-lib` (aka RippleAPI), a JavaScript API for accessing the XRP Ledger using Node.js and a browser. `ripple-lib` is the official client library of the XRP Ledger.
 <!--{# TODO: Need to refine this language -- but the point is that we need to disambiguate ripple-lib, RippleAPI, and rippled API. When you're new (and even if you just haven't used the material in a while) -- to understand the difference between these three very similarly named and related techs.  #}-->

* **[Get Started with the Data API v2](x)**

      Learn how to make your first calls to the Ripple Data API v2, which provides access to information about changes in the XRP Ledger, including transaction history and processed analytical data.
 <!--{# TODO: It would be great to more clearly define the use case for this API vs the rippled API. You could get some of the same info from either -- but what differentiates the Data API? When would I want to call this one vs rippled API? I know it has to do with transactional data and processed data -- but what is the common use case?  #}-->

* **[Get Started with Dev Tools](x)**

      Learn how and when to use each of our Dev Tools, including the XRP Ledger Test Net and other tools that enable you make requests to our APIs from your browser.
