# Manage Account Settings
<!--{# TODO: updated this tutorial section to include account creation -- which was in the Send and Receive Money tutorials section. I did this because to manage account settings - you need an account first. Seems to flow better? Or we can say before you can use these tutorials, you must create an account - see the related tutorial section in Send and Receive Money. #}-->

Create an XRP Ledger account and configure it to send and receive payments the way you want it to.

* **[Create an XRP Ledger Account](x)**

      Learn how to generate and fund an XRP Ledger address to create an XRP Ledger account.

* **[Set Up Your Account to Work with a Regular Key Pair](x)**

      Learn how to set up your account to use a regular key pair to sign transactions. Unlike with the private key of your primary key pair, if the private key of your regular key pair is compromised, you can remove or replace it without changing the rest of your account and having to re-establishing its relationships to other accounts.

* **[Set Up Issuing and Operational Addresses for Your Account](x)**

      Learn how to set up your account with multiple XRP Ledger addresses to be used strategically to minimize the risk associated with a compromised secret key.

* **[Set Up Your Account to Use Issued Currencies](x)**

      Learn how to set up your account to use issued currencies, including how to set the `NoRipple` flag and require authorization for users to hold balances issued by this account.

* **[Set Up Your Account to Use XRP](x)**

      Learn how to set up your account to use XRP, including how to enable deposit authorization, which strictly rejects any incoming money from transactions sent by other accounts.
 <!--{# TODO: the doc for this setting says: This includes transfers of XRP and issued currencies. So, is this one needs to go in that "third bucket" that applies to both XRP and issued currencies? Or is this a setting only for XRP accounts that stops it from holding issued currencies? #}-->
