# Manage the `rippled` Server
<!--{# There may be a better way to present the info on this page - especially once we have more tutorials per platform. Also, how about the sequence -- which tasks are required/commonly performed/highest priority? Which tasks are advanced/optional/lower priority? #}-->

The tutorials in this section walk you through the ins-and-outs of maintaining a `rippled` server.

* **[Install `rippled`](x)**

      Install `rippled` from a binary executable on CentOS/RedHat and Ubuntu.

* **[Build and Run `rippled` on Ubuntu](x)**

      Build `rippled` from source and run it on Ubuntu.

* **[Configure and Scale `rippled`](x)**

      Configure and scale your `rippled` to meet the needs of your use case, whether you need a test server or a robust production-grade server.

* **[Run `rippled` in Validator Mode](x)**

      Configure `rippled` to run in validator mode. In this mode, your `rippled` server participates in the XRP Ledger consensus process.

* **[Run `rippled` in Stand-Alone Mode](x)**

      Configure `rippled` to run in stand-alone mode. In this mode, your `rippled` server is not connected to the live XRP Ledger network, which is a great mode to use for testing and development.

* **[Run `rippled` in a Cluster](x)**

      Run `rippled` in a cluster to maximize efficiency.

* **[Troubleshoot `rippled`](x)**

      Troubleshoot your `rippled`, whether you are just trying to get it running, or if it's been up and running for a while.

* **[Configure the Peer Protocol](x)**

      Configure your `rippled` to use the peer protocol to send and receive connections on the peer port.
      <!--{# TODO: Not sure about this phrasing -- wondering if this should just be a part of the "Configure and Scale" rippled.cfg tutorial? #}-->
